              Gianna meaning (God is gracious) is a luxury fashion design retail brand inspired by original ideas for
              women
              design. I found this brand on my love & passion for fashion to focus on the use of staple pieces and
              sustainable
              resources to highlight on feminine beauty and figures

              Our brand creates design which tends to think outside of the box either by art, mood boards, craft etc.
              HOUSEOFGIANNA is meant to be complex and incomparable to our competitors by standing out either by the
              designs
              or the colour and context. Our pieces start off being imperfect till they are perfect as that is the
              beauty
              of
              being graceful.

            The Idalia power mesh cut out design was inspired the definition of “Gianna” meaning graceful and “Idalia”
            to
            behold the sun mostly used for Greek feminine. Its whole idea is to seemingly portray sculpted images of
            feminine goddess beauty and the textures of a power mesh design how it can flow with every shape of the
            body.
            The fabric and silhouette designs are inspired by the physique of the female form in all its embodiment,
            thus
            as a result lead us to create this beautiful piece to celebrate femineity in all its glory.

          </h2>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-loose md:text-justify">
            After our collective design with Idalia, we decided to branch even further from design cut sculpt out designs
            to using the samples guides od taffeta being inspired by its texture and the print used almost like the tie
            and dye. We experimented different types of fabric prints to get the desired print that will go with the
            asymmetric design which is very complicated as carefully tackled by our factory.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-loose md:text-justify my-2">
            The print features a rumpled tie & dye skin fabric to heighten the beauty of bright poster colours. The lining
            on the design was inspired by draw stings from sequence dress designs to sculpt the figure or rather making
            the cup asymmetric compressed and more detailed. Safiyah is one amongst other designs like Fabunni meaning the
            feature because it isn’t meant to abide by the trends but to show that styles evolve from time to time.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-loose md:text-justify">
            The cut out slit at the hem of the design is to showcase women ability to show off skin, be sexy or vulnerable
            in their own space, the public without any limitations or stereotypes because they feel comfortable in their
            skin.

            STORY OF TERESA
          </h2>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-loose md:text-justify desc" data-desc="130">
            Teresa design with others is a design under the “Ony collection” as Dress 3. The name was inspired by the love
            for the Mexican traditional names meaning ‘’Summer”. It was made for the feels and thrills of being flashy and
            elegant for the long-held summer. The knitted seashell cup design is a clear pictorial of the shells in the
            sea, or the ocean coupled by the intensity exaggeration of the woven braid capturing the afro braid sequel to
            that of a rope weaved.

          </p>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-loose md:text-justify desc my-3" data-desc="130">
            It highly emphasizes on the culture of Africans to apply embroidery stitching to beautify their fabric or
            clothing designs. For most of the African feminine beauty it will remind us of how much we basked in braids,
            knitting and weaving or even handcraft. While for some others mostly fantasized in having such traits in their
            culture or experience.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base leading-loose md:text-justify desc" data-desc="130">
            In whichever form or time, one may not have had a full experience or been a witness to, I entrust that Teresa
            and all other given names of this design will serve as an experience one that all will appreciate and flaunt.
